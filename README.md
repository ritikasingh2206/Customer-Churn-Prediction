# Customer Churn Prediction - A Power BI Project

Excited to unveil my latest Power BI project on Customer Churn Prediction!!! This project features two insightful dashboards with filters for churn risk, internet and phone service, contract details, and more. The first dashboard offers a detailed view of customer demographics, subscription patterns, contract types, billing preferences, and average charges. The second dashboard provides in-depth churn analysis by internet service, subscription duration, contract length, and payment method. With key performance indicators (KPIs) highlighting churn rate, total customers, monthly charges, and ticket analytics, this project is a valuable tool for businesses aiming to reduce churn and enhance customer retention.
